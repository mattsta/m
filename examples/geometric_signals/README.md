This example demonstrates how to use MoE (Mixture of Experts) transformers for regression tasks on geometric signals. The system learns to predict future time steps of various signal types including sine waves, composite signals, and geometric projections.

## Features

- **Signal Generation**: Creates diverse geometric signals (sine, composite, geometric shapes)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live training visualization with loss curves and expert utilization
- **Multiple Architectures**: Compare different MoE configurations (small, large, dense baseline, Sinkhorn routing)
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Performance analysis across signal types with frequency domain analysis
- **Expert Analysis**: Visualization of expert specialization and load balancing
- **Production Integration**: Seamless integration with existing inference server infrastructure
- **Dynamic Model Discovery**: Automatic model finding and management utilities
- **Model Deployment**: Production deployment with optimization and containerization
- **REST/WebSocket APIs**: Full production API server for continuous signal prediction

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Demo Dataset

```bash
# Create demo signal examples to visualize the task
uv run signals-demo demo
```

This creates example signals and saves visualizations to understand the regression task.

### 2. Train a Small Model

```bash
# Train with the small MoE configuration
uv run signals-train train --config examples/geometric_signals/configs/small_moe.yaml --name my_first_experiment
```

### 3. Evaluate the Trained Model

```bash
# Evaluate the trained model
uv run signals-eval evaluate \
    --model outputs/geometric_signals/my_first_experiment/best_model.pt \
    --config examples/geometric_signals/configs/small_moe.yaml
```

### 4. Run Full Comparison Study

```bash
# Compare all configurations
uv run signals-compare compare
```

This trains and evaluates models with all available configurations and generates a comparison report.

## Platform Integration Philosophy

### Core Platform Usage

This example demonstrates **proper platform usage**:

- **Use `m.moe` directly**: No custom MoE implementations
- **Use `m.inference_server` directly**: No custom server wrappers
- **Continuous signals as "tokens"**: Natural fit with existing API
- **Standard checkpoints**: Compatible with core platform loaders

### Key Discovery

**The existing `InferenceServer` naturally supports continuous values!**

```python
# This just works - no modification needed
server = InferenceServer(model_path="geometric_signals_model.pt", device="auto")

request = {
    "tokens": [0.1, 0.5, -0.2, 0.8, 0.3],  # Continuous float values
    "max_new_tokens": 32,                    # Predict 32 more steps
    "temperature": 1.0
}

response = await server.handle_request(request)
predictions = response["generated_tokens"]  # More continuous values
```

## Production Inference & Deployment

### Quick Inference Demo

Test the core platform integration with a trained model:

```bash
# Demo direct InferenceServer usage with continuous signals
uv run signals-inference-demo

# Start production server with auto port resolution
uv run signals-inference-demo --serve --port 8080 --device auto
```

### Production Deployment

Create optimized production deployments:

```bash
# Deploy latest trained model
uv run signals-deploy --latest production

# Deploy specific model
uv run signals-deploy outputs/geometric_signals/my_experiment/best_model.pt production

# Start the deployed server
cd deployments/production
uv run python start_server.py --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0 --device auto
```

### REST API Usage

Once a server is running, use the standard inference API:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Continuous signal prediction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/infer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "request_id": "signal_prediction",
    "tokens": [0.1, 0.5, -0.2, 0.8, 0.3, -0.1, 0.4, -0.3],
    "max_new_tokens": 16,
    "temperature": 1.0,
    "use_cache": true
  }'
```

### Core Architecture Details

The system uses the main MoE implementation from `m/moe.py` with:

- **Input Dimension**: 1 (single signal value per time step)
- **Output Dimension**: 1 (single prediction per time step)
- **Sequence Modeling**: Causal attention with RoPE position encoding
- **Modern Components**: RMSNorm, scaled initialization
- **Expert Routing**: TopK or Sinkhorn routing algorithms

### Data Flow

1. **Training**: `datasets.py` → `training.py` → `m.moe` → checkpoints
2. **Discovery**: `model_discovery.py` finds trained models dynamically
3. **Inference**: Checkpoint → `m.inference_server` (core) → continuous predictions
4. **Evaluation**: `evaluation.py` → comprehensive analysis + visualizations
5. **Deployment**: `deploy.py` → optimized models + startup scripts

### Configuration System

Each YAML config defines complete experiments:

- **Model architecture**: layers, experts, dimensions, routing
- **Training setup**: learning rates, schedules, regularization
- **Dataset parameters**: sequence lengths, signal types, sampling
- **Output management**: paths, naming, checkpointing

### Testing and Validation

The system includes extensive testing:

- **Unit tests**: Signal generation, model creation, metric computation
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end training and evaluation pipelines
- **Compatibility validation**: Production server integration verification
- **Performance benchmarks**: Throughput and accuracy measurements

## Customization

### Adding New Signal Types

Extend `datasets.py` to add new signal generation logic:

```python
def _generate_custom_signal(self, params) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Your custom signal generation logic
    pass
```

### Modifying Training

Create new config files in `configs/` directory with different:

- Model architectures (layers, dimensions, experts)
- Training hyperparameters
- Dataset parameters
- Optimization settings

### Custom Evaluation

Extend `evaluation.py` to add domain-specific metrics:

```python
def _compute_custom_metric(self, targets, predictions):
    # Your custom evaluation logic
    return metric_value
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Start Small**: Use `small_moe.yaml` for initial experiments
2. **Monitor Experts**: Watch expert utilization - unused experts indicate over-parameterization
3. **Check Convergence**: Look for smooth loss curves and stable validation
4. **Signal Quality**: Examine prediction plots to verify signal learning
5. **Frequency Analysis**: Use frequency plots to check spectral accuracy

## Research Applications

This example is ideal for:

- **MoE Architecture Research**: Compare routing algorithms and architectures
- **Time Series Learning**: Extend to real-world time series data
- **Expert Specialization**: Study how experts specialize on different signal types
- **Scaling Studies**: Test performance vs. model size relationships
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train on synthetic signals, fine-tune on real data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Training Loss Not Decreasing**

- Check learning rate (try 0.0001-0.01 range)
- Verify gradient clipping (1.0 is usually good)
- Monitor expert utilization (should be balanced)

**Predictions Look Random**

- Increase model capacity (more layers/experts)
- Extend training steps
- Check dataset generation (signals should be smooth)

**Expert Utilization Unbalanced**

- Increase load balancing weight
- Try different routing algorithms (Sinkhorn vs TopK)
- Reduce number of experts

**Out of Memory**

- Reduce batch size
- Reduce model dimensions
- Use gradient accumulation

## Next Steps

After running these experiments, consider:

1. **Real Data**: Replace synthetic signals with real-world time series
2. **Multi-dimensional**: Extend to multi-variate signal prediction
3. **Longer Contexts**: Test with longer sequence lengths
4. **Online Learning**: Implement continual learning for streaming signals
5. **Production Deployment**: Deploy trained models with the inference server integration
